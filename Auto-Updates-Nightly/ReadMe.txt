Directory contains samples of data normalization scripts set to run in sequence on a daily basis after close of business.
Scripts can be kicked off manually through browser or command line, or scheduled with crontab or wget functionality.
The custom "nextURL" function at the end of some scripts is included from the functions.php file.
